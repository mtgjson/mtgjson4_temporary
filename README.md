* Persistent immutable ID, generated for each card, stored on "_id" field.
* JSON database stored on a [different project](https://github.com/mtgjson/db)
* Sorting
    * All objects with sorted keys
    * Card arrays are sorted by number, then by multiverseid
* Command line interface for adding, removing and querying substitution rules
* Files provided on the website will be pretty-printed (instead of one-liners)
* Incorporate tokens
    * Tokens will also have unique "_id" fields.
    * Tokens will have their own array, separated from the cards array.

* Fields that will be removed:
    * id
    * imageName
* Set Specific
    * EMN
        * Try to look for meld cards automatically with the "Melds with (card-name-here)." on text.
